## Format Specifiers

A format specifier follows this prototype: `%[flags][width][.precision][length]type`
The following format specifiers are supported:


### Supported Types

| Type   | Output |
|--------|--------|
| d or i | Signed decimal integer |
| u      | Unsigned decimal integer	|
| b      | Unsigned binary |
| o      | Unsigned octal |
| x      | Unsigned hexadecimal integer (lowercase) |
| X      | Unsigned hexadecimal integer (uppercase) |
| f or F | Decimal floating point |
| e or E | Scientific-notation (exponential) floating point |
| g or G | Scientific or decimal floating point |
| c      | Single character |
| s      | String of characters |
| p      | Pointer address |
| %      | A % followed by another % character will write a single % |


### Supported Flags

| Flags | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| -     | Left-justify within the given field width; Right justification is the default. |
| +     | Forces to precede the result with a plus or minus sign (+ or -) even for positive numbers.<br>By default, only negative numbers are preceded with a - sign. |
| (space) | If no sign is going to be written, a blank space is inserted before the value. |
| #     | Used with o, b, x or X specifiers the value is preceded with 0, 0b, 0x or 0X respectively for values different than zero.<br>Used with f, F it forces the written output to contain a decimal point even if no more digits follow. By default, if no digits follow, no decimal point is written. |
| 0     | Left-pads the number with zeros (0) instead of spaces when padding is specified (see width sub-specifier). |


### Supported Width

| Width    | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| (number) | Minimum number of characters to be printed. If the value to be printed is shorter than this number, the result is padded with blank spaces. The value is not truncated even if the result is larger. |
| *        | The width is not specified in the format string, but as an additional integer value argument preceding the argument that has to be formatted. |
